# Construction Data Management and Automation
This project showcases the work done during my internship with the Public Works Department (PWD), focusing on data management, automation, and visualization for construction projects.

## Objectives
- Analyze construction project data for better resource allocation and cost estimation.
- Design automated workflows to reduce manual reporting efforts.
- Create interactive dashboards for real-time project tracking and decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Matplotlib
- **Data Management:** SQL, Excel
- **Statistical Modeling:** Regression and prediction models in Python

## Key Features
1. SQL scripts to query and manage large construction datasets.
2. Automated workflows in Python to streamline data preprocessing and reporting.
3. Power BI dashboards for visualizing material usage, costs, and project milestones.
4. Cost estimation models to predict expenses for upcoming project phases.

## Results
- Reduced project tracking and report generation time by 50%.
- Improved cost estimation accuracy by 30%.
- Created centralized data pipelines for real-time project updates.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains sample datasets for workflows and cost estimation.
- `sql/`: SQL scripts for querying and managing project data.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for automation and cost estimation.
- `dashboards/`: Power BI files for visualizing key metrics.
- `visualizations/`: Images of dashboards and charts.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PWD-Construction-Project.git
